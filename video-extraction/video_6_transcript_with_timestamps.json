  "transcript": "Wait, I have to move up since Vlad isn't here to do the drum roll. Come on, studio, drum roll. Okay, Oprah. Drum roll, it's called The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong. Ocean Vuong. It's a story, The Emperor of Gladness is an epic story about love and loneliness. It follows 19-year-old Hai, who develops a life-changing bond with an elderly widow who's suffering from dementia. So put the two of those characters together. New York Times best-selling author and award-winning poet, Ocean Vuong is here. Welcome and congratulations. Thank you so much, Gail, thank you, Oprah. Really happy to be here. First, I wanna hear why you picked it and then I wanna know what it means to you that you did pick it. Why did you pick it? I picked it because I thought that it was some of the most beautiful writing I've experienced in my lifetime. I think it's poetic literature and I think that Ocean Vuong's ability to capture the essence of just ordinary people is like nobody I've ever experienced. You always like those stories about regular people. Regular people. Regular things. And he's able to show the mastery and the extraordinariness in everybody's ordinary lives. When I tell everybody, would you just read the first chapter? And if you read the first chapter, you're gonna be hooked. And then she calls you back and says, did you finish it yet? Did you finish it yet? And what's it like when she comes to your readings? Oh my Lord, the first time she went, I read and it was lovely. Folks, as they do, they stand up and they clap. And I walk back to check on her and she's crying. She's sobbing and I thought, I said, mom, what's wrong? You didn't hear anything. I didn't do anything wrong, did I? You being the son, you make sure, did I do anything bad? And she said, no, no, no. I never thought I would live to see all these old white people clapping for my son. I never saw it that way. But she taught me how to rethink what success was for her. Is to see the effect. As a writer, I'm always interested in the language and I'm obsessed with language, but she'd helped me think that it matters what you do in the world. How your words affect the world. What it does. And she was looking at that. She really taught me how to look at where my language ends up. So what I noticed with Ocean here is that he's very nice, he's very pleasant. He seemed very feminine. I was wondering if he was gay. He is gay. So I'm leaning towards possibly double feminine side. I noticed that his answers would amp up, not down. So can you visualize that? Rather than a curve going down, because demon blast, blast last, trailing off, it was like he would finish a point and then amp up. And I was like, oh, that seems to be possibly blast not last. And I thought, oh, he seems very introverted. I wonder if he's blast not last. I wonder if he's play last. And then I just started to let it build up. And what I started to notice is I'm like, yeah, he's talking a lot. He's not only amping up, he's amping up, up, up. There's like several endings to each point that he's making. In fact, he's then just going on to the next point. And the interview person is not having to shake him by his ankles to get him to say something. In fact, the interview person can't hold on very well. And so I'm using the comparison of, is this guy leaving a void with blast? Maybe he's really excited. Maybe he's talking a lot. Anybody can do that. But no, the definition of blast over consume is talking more, explaining more, carrying on a little too long, much like I'm doing now. So I thought, huh, that's interesting. I wonder if he's sleep blast consume. I mean, he seems kind of not annoying. So I don't think he's consumed last. He seems respectable and polished up and professional and a little info dummy. And it seems like he researches and he reads and stuff like that. He writes books. So I wasn't originally leaning in that direction. Maybe he's sleep blast consume. So right away, I noticed what's happening. I'm like, oh, I'm getting pulled into trying to figure out the animals on this guy. Isn't that interesting? And every chess game is different. Maybe it's the animals that are hitting me or the sexuals, the socials. The last person I typed, Aurora, I'm like, I don't know, nothing's hitting me on the socials. With this guy, I'm like, he seems very externally motivated and he sees the working class and he sees people above him. This seems to be a two or four. This is specialization. He seems to be four. A lot of times it's very hard for me to tell the socials, but that was one of the first things I could see in him is that it seems to be a social type four, seeing the external drive and the specialization. Notice it's two different coins. Trying to break these up. But then I am conscious of what am I wrestling with? Am I going for an armbar, an ankle hook, a choke hold? What is happening? I'm like, oh, I am falling into the animal order game. So I just become conscious of that. I'm like, all right, let's go. Now, then also it's staying light and not forcing it. So the thing is, here's what people are naturally looking for. They're like, what is the thing he said that makes him sleep blast? Or da, da, da, this type, that type. What is the one thing he said? I'm like, hey, stop, think this through. If it's because he said he likes skateboards, then what your brain is going to want to do is go, oh, then these people do skateboards and those people don't do skateboards. I don't have a skateboard, therefore this. Like, hey, think it through, scale it out, really figure out then how the hell would you type people because everybody is going to say it something or do something. So it's very intuitive that you have to look beyond whatever words. It's not that a blast last can't talk too much either. So then how the hell do you really define it? You define it one coin at a time. Define it as he's triple blasting, says me, says me. Am I right? I don't know. A lot of times I am, as far as I know. The only thing I can compare it to is if my partner happens to get the same coin and I happen to get some predictability and if he happens to fall in line with other people of his type, but that again is subjective again. Now, AI loves to type people and so AI can do this pretty fast. So that could just all be a coincidence. Doesn't mean he genetically has blast over consume. Can't necessarily prove that other than the statistics here. You know what I'm saying? So on one side of the dilemma, it's like, I don't know. It's just my guess. But on the other side, it's like, if my guess is right, I should have very good predictability. It should be at such a point to where you can predict what people are gonna say and do and where their life is gonna end up. So much so that you get kind of sad and wander off. That's when you usually know because you have the results and that's what a scientific method is. It has predictability. If you're trying to raise flowers in your yard, the scientific method has the hypothesis at the beginning and then can you reproduce this? Can you predict the outcome at the end? So I would predict if he is sleep blast play last, he's gonna be an introvert. Therefore, his life tidal waves would be, hey, you need to do more. You need to engage more. You need to play more. You need to interact with others. Huh, does he have that tidal wave in his life? If he's play last and introvert. Now, if he's an extrovert, it's gonna be more of like, hey, you need to slow down. You need to consume. You need to take in. You need to refresh. Like now he's young. So if he's consume last or sleep last, he hasn't burned himself out yet because he's young. He's young. Just like your car that you don't put oil into, the engine hasn't blown itself up yet because it's still too young. So my job is to actually predict with him and reality, what tidal wave is he heading for in five, 10, 20 years? Is it an introverted tidal wave or an extroverted tidal wave? In this culture, we celebrate boys through the lexicon of violence. You're killing it. You're making a killing. Smash them, blow them up. You went into that game, guns blazing. And I think it's worth it to ask the question, what happens to our men and boys when the only way they can evaluate themselves is through the lexicon of death and destruction? And I think when they see themselves only worthwhile, when they're capable of destroying things, it's inevitable that we arrive at a masculinity that is toxic. And then now as I'm hearing stories of his life in the past, I'm kind of framing that of like, okay, so is this guy the mopey guy that's kind of play last, not engaging with people? That I'm like, I'm not really hearing those stories. I'm not hearing that vibe. I'm not seeing that as the void. I don't see other people in his life struggling with that. I don't know. I'm only just listening to a podcast of him, but it doesn't seem to be that. It seems to be that this guy's moving. He's going, he's doing. He's not afraid of the outside world. He's not timid with the outside world. Possibly, allegedly, and then I'll push it a little bit and then I'll back off. You know what I'm saying? I don't know for sure. So now here is a good setup. I love the setups. I love the traps because I know Oprah. I've been watching Oprah since I was a little kid. I know Oprah very well. And she is an ENFJ as well as her best buddy, Gail, who's the same type as Oprah. They're both audio ENFJs, blast, play, sleep, consume last. And what Shannon and I were talking about the other day, we're like, oh my gosh, this makes so much sense why Gail and Oprah are so different and yet the same damn type. Gail is possibly a social type four, would be my guess. And Oprah is a one. And boy, can you really see that? Oprah is the queen and Gail is the happy, friendly person who just dancing around. Again, not that fours do that, but fours do that. So now I've got some solid ground I can lean against. So if Ocean is hanging out with Oprah, there should, what do they have in common? Oh, decider stuff. Yes, and that was something I was able to see. I'm like, this guy is talking about decider stuff, people stuff, you, me, right and wrong, my way, that way. I'm like, okay, yeah, this is a good one. That's an easy one. This is decider stuff and he's not an EJ. Now he cares. He cares about the people. He cares the most about the people. Do you know? Oh, here we go. Do you know that you can have EJs that don't give a shit about people and IPs that do? Oh no, what are you gonna do? What's gonna happen when there's the crisscross? You gotta look for the coins. You gotta look for the definitions. It's not what you can do. It's not that everybody does the same thing. Your mommy raised you this way or that way. Social types, there's so many different things that are going on. There might be contradictions with people. Now, if you think about it, the IPs, they're going for the tribe. So a healthy IP is gonna be doing what? Talking about the tribe, wanting to engage the tribe. That's their destination. Cause we're all doing our savior bullshit so we can then get to our demons. Where's the EJ headed? To build their confidence, to love themselves, to be proud of themselves. So what I've done a few years ago is I back up and I don't any longer do EPs and IJs, or IPs and EJs. I just go observer or decider. So it's not, do you care about people or not? A lot of times it'll cluster more in the EJs, sure. What I'm going for is, is he specifically talking about others in great detail, and they have power above him, and he needs the details from them, and he's not allowed, and he's asking everybody 10 questions, and he can't have his opinion yet? No. He knows his opinion. He knows what he wants to do. He's doing his way, and then he's going, oh shit, I don't know if the tribe matches up. Oh my gosh, the tribe is doing this, and me and the tribe are off. He's doing the IP story, which I've heard a million times. There's only four stories. They're very simple. They're very boring, but we all get lost in the details of today's TV show episode, of your mommy did this, and Billy did this, and Johnny did that. You're like, hey, you're an EP. You're just feeling controlled. Okay, try and catch the next one. It's gonna be the same shit. If you are an EP, and you are triggered, you're feeling the feelings of triggered, it's only because of control. You are not going to be feeling triggered in the areas that you're naturally normally balanced. You can still have a hard time. You can still freak out. You can still be upset, but you know that triggering feeling that leads you to suicide? You know that one? That's only coming from the fourth function. Why? Because you have a genetic balance to them, whatever, things right there in the middle. I see this all day long in my line of work with people I type. It's like, they'll have the hardest time with something over here, but I'm going like, how are you blazing through this over here though? And they don't even know that that's a challenge to them. I'm like, what you're doing over here is the hardest challenge for me. You're not even addressing it. You're just doing it with your eyes closed. Do you know you have half of the genetic board just on autopilot and you don't even fucking know it? You stand with the characters. And you said you wanted every character to have their own dream, which is also true in the book. That's very important to me. I think sometimes the way we're taught to write fiction is that the plot is supreme, that everybody has to serve the plot, like the plot is some kind of master. And I never believed in that. I felt that the plot should actually showcase people where they are. And I wanted to give every character their own desire, their own dreams, however big or small, because when people get their own dreams, they get to be fully themselves. He really is a walking, talking soundbite. I know. Everything you say, I want to write it down. He's one of the most extraordinary human beings I've ever met. Okay, so something about them is jiving. What is that? Is it that they're both deciders? Yeah, I think so. Are they exchanging similar things in the extroverted world? Ooh, probably. Oprah's F.E., so does he have T.E. somewhere? Um, I don't know. It seems to be he might have the same extroverted exchangers as Oprah. And that's kind of what I was looking at, is the extroverted functions. Now, if you'll see, now if he has S.E., F.E. in the stack, it's gonna be the same as Oprah. And so the currency and the coins and the social value and the sensory and the intuition is gonna be the same exchanging. So everything that they're saying is gonna make sense to each other. You have somebody of different coins, even if they're in the same alignment with you, on the same mission, same stage in life, blah, blah, blah. There's times in the conversation, you're like, that doesn't make any sense. You just have to have a commercial break when someone's going on some T.I.N.E. trip. You're like, I don't know what they're saying. And then, oh, we're back. Now, again, doesn't prove anything, but I'm asking myself, why is there an attraction? Why do they jive with each other? Question mark hypothesis. Is it because that's S.E., F.E. in there? And so then I stop and I go, well, let me take a look at that. I jump back over to the podcast thing. And I'm like, let me look at that. Do you have F.E.? I'm like, well, he feels like he's F.I. I'm like, what the hell do I know? What the hell do I know what feels like? I'm like, well, this is D.I. He seems to be very emotional. But I'm like, these emotions are spectrum. This is trying to emotionally connect and understand with the tribe. His output, his execution, is emotional values, spectrum, happiness on a large scale. If you have the function of F.E., you don't have any idea how much stuff you know that the F.I. slash T.E.s don't know. Let me say it this way. If you have N.E., you don't have any idea how much the N.I.s don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Because I have N.I. And I'm like, look, I am just looking with, I was describing this the other day. It was really good. If you have N.I. and you're looking up at the clouds and you are a person that studies elephants for a living and everything about your world is elephants, when you look up into the clouds, all you're going to see are elephants. You know what I'm saying? Now, if you have N.E., you're like, yeah, I see an elephant and a giraffe and a squirrel and a frog and a person and a car and a spaceship. Like N.E., you're going to see all sorts of patterns in the clouds. The clouds representing, you know, the abstract chaos of life or whatever. So the N.E. can see the N.I., but the N.I. cannot see the N.E. Again, play along. It's not super fucking literal. I know you're special. Like, come on. I see that very much. Again, play along with T.E. versus T.I. I'm like, oh my gosh, how much the T.E.s can see the spectrum and the T.I.s. They can see the spectrum. I'm just saying that, but not really, because they're diving into their labs so much on their one thing, it has to sacrifice. If you're going to be super narrow, by contrast, the more narrow you are, the less wide you are. You can't be both. So it's coming from one to give to the other. Now, you can kind of build that and develop that. Like, I know I've been forced to have more F.E. like in my line of work and stuff. So it's like, I'm like F.I.ing, F.I.T.E.ing one thing at a time. Like I'm learning all this guy's stuff. I'm like, okay, social value this, social value that of this culture and these. Okay, sure, fuck, I can remember some of that stuff. But I still have to like, it's very clunky for me to like click over to that other gear and like look at some other. But I'm not naturally doing it. You gotta beat me to do it. I can do it, but I keep forgetting. You know what I'm saying? I don't get that vibe with him and Oprah. I feel like they're exchanging on the same extroverted coins. You know, where I come from, working class people, the act of reading can be very intimidating. Most of the clients in my mother's nail salon were working women, single mothers who didn't have second degrees, who only have high school education. And when I watched them, when they saw her book club show, they would get up from the chair with a different posture. And all of a sudden they said, I'm gonna walk across the strip mall, I'm gonna go to Barnes and Noble, I'm gonna get that book. Because what she gave them, she made the act of reading accessible. And I watched these women feel so empowered. And I think it opened up the possibility of reading for them in ways that they never would have gotten. And as a little boy, I didn't know I was gonna be a writer, but I think I saw that first. I said, I don't know what that is, books, but they can change the posture of somebody's mother so that they can stand a little taller and walk across and get a book with that kind of confidence because she gave them a ticket into the discourse. And that access means so much to me, especially as a first generation immigrant, as a first generation to go to college, as an educator, it does the world. So I jump over to the elimination tool just so I can go, all right, let me take another look at this. Am I going off? Okay, is this guy an observer? No, this is people talk, this is Decider stuff. This is not Observer Crazy Land. Okay, so Decider, is this DI? Yes, now he is caring a lot about people. There's a whole lot of extroverted people stuff. So I gotta make sense of that, but there's not specificness and he's not asking everybody for permission because he wants to blame them later. This is DI. And then also what else? Blast, I keep seeing Blast. Well, I'm seeing Blast, not Last. I could definitely say that, but then the more I listen to him, I'm like, no, this is actually Save Your Blast because it's up, up, up. Because if you have Blast Third or even Blast Second, you know, like a Sleep Blast Consume, you know, it's not this much. I'm like, oh shit, DI, Blast, and Extroverts, that narrows them down to my column. Okay, so then I'm pausing, I'm like, wait a minute, whoa, is this guy, is this one of me? Is it my column? Sleep Blast, I'm like, oh, but he's so friendly. He's so not annoying. He doesn't seem to be super extroverted over the top ridiculous douchebag Blast. He seems to be getting away with it very well. I'm like, yeah, okay, okay, hold on a second. Let me jump over to my celebrity archive and go to my, oh, Eddie Wu. Oh, this guy kind of reminds me of Eddie Wu. Eddie Wu is very friendly, very emotional, very smart, and not douche blastery. You got Michael Dubin, he's a super cool guy. He gets away with it. Ray Crozerworld's very introverted. He's got a super introverted vibe to him. I was very surprised. I had the hardest time typing Ray Crozerworld. It took me over a week. I think I finally had to call for help. I wasn't able to get it. I think somebody had to help me because I could not see that he was consumed last. I think on my opening moves, I had him as savior consume, and then I just couldn't undo the math. This was a couple of years ago, and I always remember that because it was quite a trip. And then also I've really taken from his work the exponential curve because I'm watching that in my life. I'm like, okay, this is something I now see and understand. Anyway, I love Ray Crozerworld's line of work. Peter Shrevepov, I've been watching him for years. Him and I used to be on the same RC groups forum back in 2004. Now he's a good sleep last play, T-I-N-I, running around, making a bunch of crazy stuff, blowing shit up. He's got the classic extroverted, running around hair on fire sleep last play. And you get the martial artists too. This is the kind of stuff that we see clustering in ops. It's like if somebody is, like Darren Brown, who's the best at being Darren Brown, it's like there's a whole string of the top mentalists are literally that exact type. And it's gonna be the same thing with professional football players. You're probably gonna have a pretty large clustering of double masculine audio ESTPs. You know what I'm saying? And so there's no coincidence that some of the best martial artists are literally of the same type. Because it's like, why? It's like Bruce Lee, like legendarily practicing the same thing for thousands and thousands of reps. With this type, they got the SE second. So it's not SE last. It's kind of a nice deal. If you're gonna be consume last, have your consume functions higher. You know what I'm saying? A consume last IP is not as bad as a consume last IP. Because the functions are higher. That does actually matter. Now, ultimately what consume last really means, it doesn't mean if you read a damn book or not. Like just, because you're taking stuff in, because there's all like Oprah's consume last and how much she's reading books. And she's talking to the tribe. She's taking in a lot of DE. Okay, so let's let's talk about that for a second consume Last is not about you're not taking in information or reading or something new or people or whatever It is ready to write this down ready to get this coin. It is not Replenishing self it's running on empty It's doing the same goddamn shows the same fucking way for eight years with nothing new on absolute empty You know listen preparing for the fucking show on a walk right before you sit down and record don't have any slides Don't have a fucking camera empty empty empty empty empty same old thing running from fucking Microsoft AOL Outlook That's that's how I picture it John McArthur same thing same way same messages Just running the same shit now Michael Dubin really cool really fun You know getting away with all that stuff primitive technology like they're doing a little so it's it's one of these Function disorders that tend to socially you get away with it for a long period of time because you're like you're you're you're doing shit You're moving you're Oprah and so people are gonna praise you for being an extrovert consume last sleep last You're gonna get praised for being an extrovert cuz you're doing stuff But then the sleep lasts, you know They eventually crash and their fucking brains fall out of their head and then the consume last it just slowly catches up with them Where they're just running on empty doing the same shit It's just outdated as hell, but they can't do nothing about it because they gotta produce today And they just get stuck in this loop But if you're in your 20s these kind of things aren't showing yet It really does take until you're older most likely for this stuff to really pile up Then you have the two characters Hi is very young and then the grandmother in this story the two of them end up together and it's an unlikely duo But it works the age difference. She has dementia She sees him on the bridge and she calls him back to life And I think what I wanted to show is that sometimes you don't have a grand narrative that brings you back to Meaningful life often what it is is that you realize you're more useful to somebody else than you were ever useful to yourself mmm, and the the bond the unfamiliar bond is actually very Very formidable and familiar because both in our society both the young people and the very old have been pushed on the margins So there's loneliness masses amount of loneliness on both sides of that age spectrum And in fact when they come together, they realize oh, we're in the same realm We've been pushed outside of the frame and we only have each other to make a life worth living But the more I was listening to this guy the more I noticed. Oh my gosh This guy's just talking about crazy abstract stuff not giving a lot of details not giving a lot of clarities Really has a lot of fun jumping over to analogies and different pictures and different concepts like okay This is this is intuition talk and I'm like, oh, this is how annoying it sounds It's like it's just also like he's changing the station It's like I like is this real or is this an analogy your brain has to like keep track of like is that an analogy? Or is that actual real not super bad, but I was noticing some pretty strong intuition and it's the same old stories Like if you listen to him long enough like an hour it starts to loop back around So it might seem like any for the first 20 minutes because it's new to you But that's why I like to watch a couple hours if I can't have somebody because I'm like, oh now you're repeating yourself Now I can see how far the walls of Jericho go. You can't type somebody from just watching them for 20 fucking minutes you don't know the whole rest of the story di n Blast extroverts and this is Fe So again, this is like the last person this now narrows him down to so this is Ti and then I'm like, I guess And I did hear some of that. I did hear the NT talk I did hear him talking about thinking things through and puzzling and logic But he doesn't he feels NF or SF or NF or you don't say he doesn't feel like an NT I mean, this is NT like yes, let's jump back over to our somebody archive Tim Allen. Well, I mean, he's kind of NT He's kind of like, you know, it was like ST, you know, or he's kind of funny doing his construction like Eddie Woo, yeah, sure kind of Ray Kurzweil. Absolutely. Bruce Lee. No doesn't feel NT I mean, I guess if you listen to him talk, there's there's a lot of smarts Israel. I don't know feels SF to me Mark Manson Definitely see the Ti in there Ti St primitive technology guy feels like ST. So, you know I'm saying they don't necessarily Peter Striepel. He's definitely NT He feels NT. He plays the archetype of NT kung-fu guy very NF So hit and miss with the letter alignment can't you know? But when I go around the other direction of going DI and he's speaking Oprah FE I'm like shit that's gonna be Ti at the top did so then go make that work And if you listen to him, you do see it it is there but he's not living his life Fucking Kurzweil style, you know I'm saying if you have a big giant Ti head you can use that for Ti shit You were allowed to do that or you can be a rock star or you can write a book or you can dive into your Fe or you can do whatever the fuck you want But you're still bringing that Ti FE set of coins with you If you have a streetcar, you can take it off-roading like you can do whatever you want with your functions It's just it's gonna be noticeable what you have and it's gonna be interesting weird or awesome Depending on what arena you get into you know, I'm saying like somebody who's writing really deep emotional SF stuff is coming from an NT IP starting point that guy has to go through all of the journeys of hell to get there So his book is probably gonna be pretty fucking rich because it's not surface level It's not just his saviors, which is why he's fucking talking to Oprah and he's super young All right One last thing what ops is really tracking is the big three is what I call this is what I use ops for is number One observer to sighter you're going to be triggered by observer to sighter stuff. That's the predictability I don't know exactly what details your life is in and that's what people just get stuck and lost like yeah But my mommy said and Sally said and Billy said and they're so trapped in the current little fucking sideshow joke of their life of Today's episode of today's drama and you cannot wake them up out of it. They cannot wait. Okay, that's just an EP title That's just an IP title. That's just like no. No, you're not You're not listening You don't understand and then they said this and then Johnny said this and then Billy said this and then the meter maid came and Then they did a bit of a like hey Hey there's gonna be another one and you notice that the previous 50 were all the same and then the next 50 are gonna be the No, but they just go right back to the story. They can't get out of the story I very rarely do I see people that actually can get out and be like, oh this this is all the same You know, it's been weird and what's been a surprise is It's not Necessarily an age, you know I thought it'd be mostly older people which sure it kind of is and it's certainly not a type because I'm thinking of the people I talked to and I work with and I'm interact with like people I've met through the community and stuff Some like one of them is 19 and he's like in fucking New Zealand or Australia, you know And it's like how is he so self-aware and he sleep laughs like how the hell and like how is he seeing is like Oh my whole life it's just these ops programs repeating themselves like you're not supposed to see that and I'll see people of different ages and different types and It's just like I don't know what it is. I don't think it can be reproduced It seems to be more of a thing where the universe just chooses some people or not But like other people it's pretty insane how much they can know about ops like they can be very smart Know all the technical stuff inside and out but like Homer fucking Thompson can't catch One thing in their life can't catch the pattern in real time Because ops to them is like only when they're doing their typing video or only when they're watching one of these stupid Blaster fucking videos from Dave and then then they're like off the clock the rest of their life. It's like no It's happening all the time. So observer decider you're going to be triggered by those Those are the biggest ones to really look at that's what that's what you're gonna be Fearing and triggering that's gonna be like almost like a daily frustration thing the second thing that's kind of a longer tidal wave it usually takes what I say by the end of the year is if you're An extrovert sleep last or consume less in some way shape or form when your tidal wave comes in at the end of the year You're gonna need some downtime. You need some consume and sleep both of them slow down process replenish self take in new It is kind of interesting that the two introverted animals work together and the two extroverted animals work together No, I'm saying but I'm having my consume last crashes It's also taken out my sleep and I see this with my sleep last friends as well And then if you're an introvert, it's time to go out blast play. Maybe your save your play Maybe your save your blast, but one of those is at the bottom go do more shit get out there Stop making a fucking perfect start communicating get going and then what seems to be like the super decade like 20 30 40 50 Years is the social type one That's where like if you're a two or a four with all that external drive You're kind of a DE for the decade Even if you're an IP or a fucking handsome IJ DI like me It's like at the end of the decade by the time you're 47. You're like, why am I just what is my stuff? Where's mine? Where's mine? Where the fuck is money? Why am I not replenishing myself? I've given everything everywhere and I don't have nothing How did this happen? And I'm like, yeah, how did that happen? Now? I'm super selfish on the day to day I'll steal your sandwich if you're not eating fast enough, but like how the hell do I then end up with fucking nothing 40 years later That's what the twos and the fours they finally the slaves revolt and be like, you know I'm fucking tired of serving everybody and so it's an EJ style tidal wave You know I'm saying like I have gotten so much help in my own life with my demon external drive twos and fours From looking at the math of the EJs I'm like, oh I'm the EJ for the decade and then if you're a one or three you got a different kind of tidal wave Going on but that's the that's the things to look for and predict not do you resonate with what flavor ice cream like who cares? About the silly shit all of the fun little anecdotes and you look like people of your same type, but it's real fun But what's more fun is not getting dragged into hell and being stuck there and having no idea how you got there and no idea How to get out I had I had noisy roommates They had kids and I I struggled, you know I was an adjunct at NYU and I would go home Working on this book and and I'd looked at the corner of my room and I said, where can I the furthest place? I can go from these folks there. They were kind folks, but they were so noisy and it was the closet Oh, wow, and the closet was the furthest place away and I know for a gay writer. It's the irony is not lost But I thought I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna reclaim that place And you know, you know, it was beautiful you go in there and what was once a prison I turned it into a portal to write this book. That's fantastic. And I went in there with a little lamp in my laptop and it was perfect.",
